<p1>Currently, It's Sunday and I'm preparing to train my Uncle's new Shepherd puppy- Ryku. He's only 1 years old. Ryku enjoys chewing up sprinklers, wire door screens, digging to China, snuggling, and barking at strangers.</p1>
<br>
<br>
<p2>Good thing my two 10 year old Shibas have taught me a trick or two. With the help of leading dog trainer- <a href="http://www.andreaarden.com">Andrea Arden</a> and agility champion <a href="http://www.noordelijk.com">Kris Seiter</a> in the past, we've learned how to deal with destructive behavior and barking with positive reinforcement training.</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p3><strong>For Ryku, we're going to start with:</strong><p3>
<br>
<br>
<p4>When your dog does something good, react with high-pitched praising, petting lovingly, or giving them a high-value treat. Chances are the dog is going to do more of the good behavior, because he receives a good reward after he does it. For example, the high value treat is like you receiving a $100 bill when you do something good. You'd keep producing the good behavior if you were handed a $100 bill every time right? Yes, of course! But, don't give away those high-value treats ALL the time, or your dog won't value them. If you were handed $100. all the time the bill would lose it's value. So, treat your dog to praising and high value treats when he does a good behavior. Apply to any favorable behavior you want your dog to do more of. <a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/dogs/tips/dog_training_positive_reinforcement.html">More positive training information here</a>.</p4>

<br>
<strong>2). Treat Toys = meal bowl</strong>
<br>
<br>
<p5>If you have a very energetic dog, or a working dog breed, they're smart, have a ton of energy, and love working. Often when these smart breeds don't receive the mental stimulation and exercise they need, they can adopt destructive behavior. For my uncle, his German Shepherd puppy- Ryku is chewing up his back yard. This is not safe for his dog or home. An easy way to remedy this is to ONLY feed Ryku his meals with treat toys. If the treat toy is Ryku's only source of food, you can bet this puppy will be spending his time figuring out how to get his meal out of this toy. Ryku will be working for his food, problem solving, receiving a good reward for his work, and exerting energy. It's a win win for the dog and owner. Dog treat toys are a genius invention! My favorite products are the <a href="http://www.kongcompany.com/the-world-of-kong/the-kong-story/">Kong Treat Toys</a> and <a href="http://www.busybuddytoys.com">Busy Buddy toys</a>, but there are many to choose from <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=2767187">here</a>. I fill the Kong toys with dog food, and sometime seal it with peanut butter. If I want my dog to be working on his food for hours I seal the opening with a nut butter and then freeze it. It will keep them busy for longer. <a href="http://healthypets.mercola.com/sites/healthypets/treat-release-dog-toys.aspx">More information on training with treat toys here</a>. </p5>
<br>
<br>
<p6><strong>3). Barking</strong></p6>
<br>
<br>
<p7>
German Shepherds in particular can be very protective, and a territorial breed. Ryku barks at every stranger that comes near the house. In his mind, he's doing his job. However, there are friends that visit where my Uncle wants Ryku to be nice to, as well as be a guard dog. The best way to do this is:<p7>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>a). Mark the times when you want your dog to be friendly to a stranger with positive reinforcement. You can mark the behavior with words such as, "Who's that? Oooooh, it's your friend. It's your friend." You can practice this with family members and people your dog already likes. Repeat the same tone and words with positive reinforcement (praising, petting, or high value treats). That way every time your dog hears those same words he will remember a positive feeling.</li>
	<li>b). When a stranger comes to the house who you don't like, don't say a word. Allow Ryku to bark. This way Ryku is still allowed to bark, protect his family, and you can have a guard dog.</li>
	<li>c). There will be times where your dog will bark at a new person you bring to his territory that he just doesn't like. If he barks incessantly, I find what helps is to cup my hand over his eyes and soothingly say, "Hey buddy, it's your friend, it's okay". The eye cover sort of takes the dog out of the moment to remember the command if the dog is too excited (which can happen to puppies easily).</li>
	<li>d). If the dog is still too excited, find something to keep him busy- like throw him a frozen treat toy ;) That will quiet him and give him something positive to work on so you can hang out with your friend.</li>
</ul>
